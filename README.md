## Of the most commonly declared disaster types, which states are the most impacted (have the highest number of declared disasters)?
For Flood disasters, the state with the most declarations was Texas with 40. The top 3 were Texas, California and North Dakota. 

## Which states receive the most funding for a specific disaster type?
The top state to receive the most funding for Flood disasters was North Dakota ($137,455,700). Followed by Iowa ($92,165,440)
and Louisiana ($81,701,370).

The states with the most declared Sever Storms is Oklahoma (44), Alabama(41), Mississippi (38), Kansas(38), and Missouri (35). The states with the highest total obligated funding amounts are Iowa ($359,639,200), Florida ($187,065,300), Missouri ($180,249,200), Calisfornia ($165,767,800), and Alabama ($122,139,300)

The states with the most declared hurricanes is Florida (45), North Caorlina (30), Louisiana (27), Texas (22), and Alabama (21). The states with the highest total obligated funding amounts are Louisiana ($2,072,860,000), New York ($972,374,200), Florida ($865,053,500), Texas ($771,622,600), and Mississippi ($362,700,500). Louisiana has over twice the funding of the next closest state (New York) which is almost entirely due to hurricane Katrina which accounts for ~$1.6 Billion of disaster funding, over 50% more funding than New York over the entire dataset, showing that single disasters can completely dwarf all other disasters of that type when it comes to funding


The top state to receive the most funding for Flood disasters was North Dakota ($137,455,700). Followed by Iowa ($92,165,440) and Louisiana ($81,701,370).
## Is there a discrepancy between disaster declarations and funding across locations
There is a large discrepancy. The main take away is that there isn't a direct correlation between the number of disasters and funding.  Disasters happen and their magnitude varies so it's difficult to find a concrete correlation.
