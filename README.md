## Of the most commonly declared disaster types, which states are the most impacted (have the highest number of declared disasters)?
For Flood disasters, the state with the most declarations was Texas with 40. The top 3 were Texas, California and North Dakota. 

## Which states receive the most funding for a specific disaster type?
The top state to receive the most funding for Flood disasters was North Dakota ($137,455,700). Followed by Iowa ($92,165,440)
and Louisiana ($81,701,370).
## Is there a discrepancy between disaster declarations and funding across locations
There is a large discrepancy. The main take away is that there isn't a direct correlation between the number of disasters and funding.  Disasters happen and their magnitude varies so it's difficult to find a concrete correlation.

## Which states have the highest incidents of disaster declarations?
The states with the highest incidents of disaster declarations are:
1. Texas 
2. California
3. Oklahoma


## Which type of disaster is the most commonly declared across the US and US territories?
US President Jimmy Carter signed the executive order that created the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on April 1, 1979.  The goal behind FEMA was to coordinate the federal government's role in preparing for, preventing, mitigating the effects of, responding to, and recovering from all domestic disasters, whether natural or man-made, including acts of terror. Since the agency's inception the most common disater type to be declared has been Fire with 1403 declarations. This is followed by Severe Storm (982), Flood (836) and Hurricane (374)


## Of the most commonly declared disaster types, which states are the most impacted (have the highest number of declared disasters)?
For Fire disasters, the state with the most declarations was Texas with 250. Rounding out the top 5 are California (241)
Washington (108), Oklahoma (105), and Oregon (77).


## Which states receive the most funding for a specific disaster type?
The top state to receive the most funding for Fire disasters was New York ($264,635,280). Followed by California ($206,326,360)
Texas ($26,401,012) and Washington ($7,955,984).

## Is there a discrepancy between disaster declarations and funding across locations
Funding for Fire did not match our hypothesis as New York received the greatest amount of funding with $264,635,280. Upon further research this outlier was due to the Sept. 11th terror attacks being declared as a fire disaster. The remanding funds were distributed as expected, mostly following the thought that more disaster declarations equals more money.
